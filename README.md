# DoW:DE anti-sync-error script
Script to fix Sync error on multiplayer games

Original script from https://gist.github.com/TechT10n/79b853003f2e9841a18e8b6decd0fd3e

I have added path for flatpak steam and changed game id for DoW:DE
Tested on Debian 13 and flatpak Steam with proton 9.0.4
It was the only solution, which allowed me to finish multiplayer match.
I am not scripting/linux expert so add comment if there is any error in text.
